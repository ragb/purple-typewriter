= Pidgin Typewriter =

Pidgin Typewriter is a pidgin plugin that plays a typewriter sound when buddies are typing. In fact it can play any sound, however the typewriter sound stolen from the JAWS scripts for MSN/WLM gave it the name. This plugin may work with other libpurple clients but main support is for pidgin.
